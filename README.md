# Wisdom Optical Character Recognition project STS
WISDOM or Written Information Scanning and Data Observation Module is a digital test checker that uses Optical Character Recognition Handwritten character recognition technology to detect and convert images of computer-written, typewritten, handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text from a scanned document and a photo of a document (Deneke et al., 2024). WISDOM, as the name suggests, performs Written Information Scanning on different images taken and uses data analytics to infer the character that was written.

# File Structure
**main.py** - this is where the main code goes. The goal is to limit number of lines to 100. Other 
functions will go to the modules folder and will be imported.

**modules** - this is where modules will go, things like banner, minor functions etc.
